        Welcome to the CSS animation Page. Here i will upload and save all the CSS animation codes with description of
        their usage. So that in future if i need any kind of help with the animation thing i can easily find all the
        codes here.
        <br>
        <br>
        And i will try to add description of all the other codes i have used. The codes i don't know or the codes which
        i will hear for the first time or if i don't know about the function of the codes.

            Animation basics
        </h2>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="anime1" ;>
        <div class="box1">
            <strong> Animation </strong>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="para" id="second p">
        So to create an animation like this we will have to give it a name like i gave "ani1". Then you ll have to use
        key frames by typing @keyframes on the css page and the name of the animation. Then open two selectors "from"
        and "to" and then you can set the values like i made it start from 150px too 450px to create this kind of
        animation. You can set the timing using the animation duration property and you can also set, how many times the
        animation will run by using animation iteration count.
        <br>
        Now let't talk about the other funcions of this animation
        <div class="anime2">
            <div class="box2">
                <strong>Properties</strong>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            So the other properties that have been used in this animations are:- <br>
            1. Animation fill mode: With this function you can select if the animation is going stop at the end or just
            continue going. I have selected the forwards option so it stops when the animation is complete.(You'll have
            to set the animation count to one to apply this properly).
            <br>
            2. Animation timing function: The animation timimg function is used to tell the compiler, when to slow down
            the animation and when to speed up. There are a lot of options i have selected ease out which means the
            animation will start slow and will speed up at the end moment.
            <br>
            3.Animation delay: The animation delay is nothing but telling the compiler to start the animation a bit
            later after loading. I have set the timing for 3 seconds and as a result the animations starts a bit later
            instead of starting right after loading the page.
            <br>
            4. Animation direction: with this property you can set, like from where should the animation start. From the
            starting to ending or from the ending to the start.
        </div>
        <div class="anime3">
            <div class="box3">
                <strong>Syntex</strong>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Here we have used the other syntex property which indicates what to do when the animation is that much
            completed. We have used the % type.
            <br>
            Firts of all i have seleted 0%, means when the animation will start what will happen. then selected 25% and
            75% and 100%. So when the animation starts the box starts to move towards right, when the animation is 25%
            finished you the box will be at complete right. After that the box will move downwards and then on the left
            side and this will continue.
            <br>
            <br>
            You can write down all the functions in a single line, the order is like: Animation name, animation
            duration, animation timing function, animation delay, animation iteration count, animation fill mode;......
        </div>
        <div class="div">
            <h2 class="heading" id="basics">
                Transitions
            </h2>
        </div>
        <div class="trans">
            <div>
                <strong>Transition</strong>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            This is the css trnasition property. With this property you can change the back ground color, color and a
            lot of things and this function has a lot of options too. And it also has the similar functions as
            animation; like trnasition duration, Transition timing function, Transition delay.......lavda lassan.
            I have used the trnasition duration only.
            <br>
            <br>
            you can use this trnasition shorthand property; trnasition: backgound-color, Transition duration, transition
            timing funcion, and transition delay.
        </div>
        <div class="container">
            <div class="trans1">
                <div class="text1">
                    <strong>Box Size</strong>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            So it is the same css transition property with some more funcions added into it. like you can see when you
            put your mouse pointer in the box it transits into a circle and changes its size also. For the circle you
            just have to set the transition border radius same as its height and width. And most importantly you will
            have to change the trnasition property form backgound-color to all so that the other funcions like timing
            and all applies in it.
        </div>
        <div class="div">
            <h2 class="heading" id="basics">
                Transform
            </h2>
        </div>
        <div class="transform">
            <div class="transf1">
                <strong>
                    Transform
                </strong>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            This is the css tranform property. You can use the tranform property to creater animations like rotating the
            elemnt or moving the elment or changing its shape and all. Right now i have used the rotate proprety.
            Firstly create 2 div with classes or id. then target them add background height and width to the child div
            and use flex box to centerlise the items inside and then use the hover selelctor and then inside the hover
            you can use transform property. Remember to use the transition property to add timing and other stuff.
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            Now lets talk about the other properties we can use with the transform.....
         </div>
        <div class="transform">
            <div class="transf2">
                <strong>Properties</strong>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="para">
            There are a few more transfomr properties that i have commented out in the css page like transitionx transitiony and others. This is the skew property which changes its shape and you can also change the backgound-color but i didn't wanted to change it thats why i kept it this one color only.
        </div>
